<p>Number of Shots Made increased in a near linear fashion for most of the recent NBA. We can <p> conclude mostly that the number of 3 pointers made is directly varied with the number of shots<p> taken. An increase in volume usually will lead to more shots made, they are not independent or<p> luck based.

<p> The number of 3 pointers attempted has been steadily increasing over the years with specific ups <p> and downs, recently the modern NBA has seen a dramatic uptick in 3 point shots attempted with<p> a subsequent increase in 3 pointers made. The league has definitely been pushed to a more shot<p> makers versus big body players. The good news is the increase in shots did not lead to a dip in FG%,<p> which means the players have gotten better at 3 point shooting over the years.

<p> We can conclude as well for the most part that the quality of 3 point shooter has been constant,<p> but the NBA as a league is moving towards a more 3 point league rather than a paint league.<p> The field goal 3 point percentage was fluctuating in the early 80s but as the years went on,<p> the league got settled and there was a standard set at around 34% 3PM. It has been constant for<p> about 20 years but with the dramatic increase in 3PA, we can conclude shooters have become better
