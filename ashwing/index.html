			Speed vs Torque graph </b> <p> <img src= http://svsm.taylorbrockman.com/~ashwing5511/gnugraph.png> <p> The dataset comprises of several sets of sensor data collected from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM)<p>  deployed on a test bench. The PMSM represents a german OEM's prototype model. Test bench measurements were<p>  collected by the LEA department at Paderborn University.
		<p> .<p> <b> Analysis and conclusions <p>  </b> From the graph plotted above using gnuplot, we can see that as speed increases outwards from zero, the torque begins to decrease towards zero
