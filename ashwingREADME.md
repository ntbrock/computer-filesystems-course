The final outcome of my project is a public website that contains an analysis of a big data set that contains over 55 thousand data points describing the torque and speed of a certain electric motor

I began by finding a large dataset on kaggle.com for electric motor temperature. The dataset had nearly 1 million rows of data and over 8 different tests; however, due to the upload limit on github, I shortened the data down to 5.5 percent of the original data. From here, I downloaded the csv file, and learned how to delimit the dataset in excel with semicolons to get an idea of what I will be doing with linux.
